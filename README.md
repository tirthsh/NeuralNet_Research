# NeuralNet_Research

Worked on learning the basics of Neural networks while working with Tensorflow and Keras API calls. 
Use Anaconda Navigator to run Juypter.

1. Check out my blog on Deep Neural Networks - https://medium.com/@tirthsh0/intro-to-deep-neural-networks-is-it-really-that-hard-94b74e6da790

2. Have a read at the following paper: http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Gurari_VizWiz-Priv_A_Dataset_for_Recognizing_the_Presence_and_Purpose_of_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf

3. Was able to create CNN model for the above paper, here's the blog for it: https://medium.com/@tirthsh0/recognizing-presence-of-private-content-in-images-taken-by-visually-impaired-users-vizwiz-dataset-73bef56b8a37
